The read-it-later app Omnivore recently announced that [it is joining the ElevenLabs company](https://blog.omnivore.app/p/omnivore-is-joining-elevenlabs). Unfortunately, as part of this process, they also announced that the service will be shut down, and all user data will be deleted at the end of November.

We understand that this situation may be frustrating and unsettling. We are actively working on an Omnivore importer so you can transfer your content to wallabag.

In the meantime, as this work is still in progress, **we strongly recommend that you request an export of your Omnivore data as soon as possible**. This data will be provided in a zip archive, and once our importer is released, you will be able to add your saved content.

Please note that, at least for now, the importer is not expected to support highlights.
