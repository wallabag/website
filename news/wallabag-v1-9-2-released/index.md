wallabag 1.9 is still alive! And we just released a new version to fix JSON export and to add some specific websites configuration (useful to fetch articles). 

[Download the new version here](https://www.wallabag.org/pages/download-wallabag.html). 

[Don't forget we are working very hard on wallabag v2](https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2016/04/11/wallabag-201), so if you want to have new features in wallabag, it's better to migrate to this great new version. 

See you soon!
